h)sI) inheritance is when a class "inherits" or receives all 
	variables and functions from another class as well as its own. 
   II) polymorphism is where you have many inherited classes that use a same named function to do a different task
   III) Encapsulation is a way of protecting your data by removing direct
   	access from the user by putting it into private section. Access
	for the end user through getting and setting functions.
i) the differences in this style of managing git pushes to the main repository
	is that in the dictator and lieutenants one, one person has 
	100% control over the final product where in the integration
	management there are multiple repositories where conflict resoltions
	occur and are fixed by individuals, not a "higher up" developer.
j) a larger team would benefit from a dictator and lieutenants workflow
	because it is much easier for 3 or 4 people to make a decision with
	one person with the final say than 100 people trying to get their
	idea in the final project.
